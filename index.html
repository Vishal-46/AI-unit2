            <p>Route-finding problem is defined in terms of specified locations and transitions along links

                computer networks,military operations planning,and air line travel planning systems.

            <h4>Tourning problems:</h4>
            <p>Touring problems are closely related to route-finding problems,but with an important difference.
                Consider for example,the problem,”Visit every city at least once” as shown in Romania map.
                As with route-finding the actions correspond to trips between adjacent cities. The state space, 
                however,is quite different.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>TSP:</h4>
            <p> Is a touring problem in which each city must be visited exactly once. The aim is to find the 
                shortest tour.The problem is known to be NP-hard. Enormous efforts have been expended to 
                improve the capabilities of TSP algorithms. These algorithms are also used in tasks such as 
                planning movements of automatic circuit-board drills and of stocking machines on shop floors.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>VLSI layout:</h4>
            <p>A VLSI layout problem requires positioning millions of components and connections on a chip 
                to minimize area ,minimize circuit delays,minimize stray capacitances,and maximize
                manufacturing yield. The layout problem is split into two parts : cell layout and channel 
                routing.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>ROBOT navication:</h4>
            <p>ROBOT navigation is a generalization of the route-finding problem. Rather than a discrete set 
                of routes,a robot can move in a continuous space with an infinite set of possible actions and 
                states. For a circular Robot moving on a flat surface,the space is essentially two-dimensional.
                When the robot has arms and legs or wheels that also must be controlled,the search space
                becomes multi-dimensional. Advanced techniques are required to make the search space finite.  
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>AAC:</h4>
            <p>The example includes assembly of intricate objects such as electric motors. The aim in assembly
                problems is to find the order in which to assemble the parts of some objects. If the wrong order 
                is choosen,there will be no way to add some part later without undoing somework already done.
                Another important assembly problem is protein design,in which the goal is to find a sequence of 
                Amino acids that will be fold into a three-dimensional protein with the right properties to cure
                some disease.

        <div>
            <h4>Internet Searching:</h4>
            <p>In recent years there has been increased demand for software robots that perform Internet 
                searching.,looking for answers to questions,for related information,or for shopping deals. The 
                searching techniques consider internet as a graph of nodes(pages) connected by links.
